# drum-game
## Context
Adapted from Drum Kit lesson from App Brewery. The original lesson taught how to create the web page with the drum kit.  

I've adapted it into a game where the player listens or watches the program play a random sequece. Then, the player has to recreate it in order to score a point.  
  
There are sliders to adjust the difficulty accordingly.  
  
There is also a fun "Random Beat" button to tell the program to play a long, random sequence

## Technologies
HTML  
CSS  
JS  
Bootstrap 5

## Credits

## TODO

Refactoring  

## Future Work
